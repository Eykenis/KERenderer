# KERenderer
![sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75401909/161378679-9e5d0b58-2be9-4cda-8b9f-e3db9ea135de.png)
My first attempt to build my own software renderer

Though it's almost all imitating [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer), refactoring is put on my agenda, to fix exisiting bugs in tinyrenderer and use graphic interfaces to make it cross-platform and real-time.
## file formats
Truevision TGA

Wavefront OBJ
## some short-term goals
- make it real-time.
- make uv texture avaliable (supporting .mtl file extension)
# Release usage
- unzip and run KERenderer.exe.
- in console you can type integers to determine which and how to render.
